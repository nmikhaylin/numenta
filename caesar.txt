The Soliloquy of Marc Antony Upon Learning of the Assassination of Caesar

O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou are the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever livèd in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
