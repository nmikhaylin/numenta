The Soliloquy of Marc Antony Upon Learning of the Assassination of Caesar

O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou are the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever livèd in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarered by the hands of war
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
Then Caesar's spirit, raging with revenge,


ALL HAIL CAESAR

ALL HAIL THE PEOPLE AND THE REPUBLIC OF ROME!!!
