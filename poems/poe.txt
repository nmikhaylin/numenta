Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore
From that rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore
Nameless here forevermore



But I know that it is tell-tale that touches my life....
